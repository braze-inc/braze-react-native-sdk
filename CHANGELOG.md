## 8.1.0

##### Added
- Push notification objects are now accessible in the JavaScript layer via new fields on the `PushNotificationEvent` interface.
  - Deprecates the following fields from the `PushNotificationEvent` interface in favor of the new names that can be used on both iOS and Android:
    - `push_event_type` -> Use `payload_type` instead.
    - `deeplink` -> Use `url` instead.
    - `content_text` -> Use `body` instead.
    - `raw_android_push_data` -> Use the `android` object instead.
    - `kvp_data` -> Use `braze_properties` instead.
- Adds iOS support for the listener event `Braze.Events.PUSH_NOTIFICATION_EVENT`.
  - On iOS, only `"push_opened"` events are supported, indicating the user interacted with the received notification.
  - The iOS event does not support the deprecated legacy fields mentioned above.
- Adds methods to manually perform the action of an In-App Message or Content Card when using a custom UI.

- Updates the native iOS bridge [from Braze Swift SDK 6.6.0 to 7.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/6.6.0...7.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- Renames the `Banner` Content Card type to `ImageOnly`:
  - `BannerContentCard` → `ImageOnlyContentCard`
  - `ContentCardTypes.BANNER` → `ContentCardTypes.IMAGE_ONLY`
  - On Android, if the XML files in your project contain the word `banner` for Content Cards, it should be replaced with `image_only`.
- `Braze.getFeatureFlag(id)` will now return `null` if the feature flag does not exist.
- `Braze.Events.FEATURE_FLAGS_UPDATED` will only trigger when a refresh request completes with success or failure, and upon initial subscription if there was previously cached data from the current session.

##### Added
- Adds `Braze.getUserId()` to get the ID of the current user.

## 7.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updates the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 26.3.2 to 27.0.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2701).

- Adds support for nested custom user attributes.
  - The `setCustomUserAttribute` now accepts objects and arrays of objects.
  - Adds an optional `merge` parameter to the `setCustomUserAttribute` method. This is a non-breaking change.
  - Reference our [public docs](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support/) for more information.
- Adds `Braze.setLastKnownLocation()` to set the last known location for the user.
- Adds `Braze.registerPushToken()` in the JavaScript layer to post a push token to Braze's servers.
  - Deprecates `Braze.registerAndroidPushToken()` in favor of `Braze.registerPushToken()`.

## 6.0.1

##### Fixed
- Adds `'DEFINES_MODULE' => 'YES'` to the iOS Podspec when compiling the Turbo Module to prevent the need for static framework linkage when using the Braze Expo plugin.

## 6.0.0

##### Breaking
- If you are using the New Architecture, this version requires React Native `0.70` or higher.
- Fixes the sample setup steps for iOS apps conforming to `RCTAppDelegate`.
  - ⚠️ If your app conforms to `RCTAppDelegate` and was following our previous `AppDelegate` setup in the sample project or [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/react_native/react_sdk_setup/?tab=ios#step-2-complete-native-setup), you will need to reference our [updated samples](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/AppDelegate.mm) to prevent any crashes from occurring when subscribing to events in the new Turbo Module. ⚠️
- If your project contains unit tests that depend on the Braze React Native module, you will need to update your imports to the `NativeBrazeReactModule` file to properly mock the Turbo Module functions in Jest.
  - For an example, refer to the sample test setup [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/tree/master/__tests__).
- Updates the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 25.0.0 to 26.3.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v25.0.0...v26.3.1#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- Fixes the presentation of in-app messages to match the documented behavior.
  - Calling `subscribeToInAppMessages` or `addListener` in the Javascript layer will no longer cause a custom `BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate` implementation on iOS to be ignored.
  - Calling `Braze.addListener` for the `inAppMessageReceived` event will subscribe in both the Javascript and the native layers (iOS + Android). This means it is no longer required to call `Braze.subscribeToInAppMessage`.
    - Per the Braze documentation, you do not need to explicitly call `subscribeToInAppMessage` to use the default In-App Message UI.
  - See our documentation for more details around [Advanced customization](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/react_native/inapp_messages/?tab=ios#advanced-customization).

##### Added
- Migrates the Braze bridge to a backwards-compatible [New Architecture Turbo Module](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/pillars-turbomodules).
  - This is a non-breaking change to your existing imports of the Braze SDK if you are using React Native `0.70`+.
  - The Braze SDK continues to be compatible with both the New Architecture and old React Native architecture.
- Adds the `getDeviceId` method to replace `getInstallTrackingId`, which is now deprecated.
- Updates the native iOS bridge [from Braze Swift SDK 6.3.1 to 6.4.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/6.3.1...6.4.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
- Adds a conditional library namespace to the Android `build.gradle` file to prepare for React Native 0.73, which uses AGP 8.x.
  - For more details, refer to this [React Native announcement](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/671).

## 5.2.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue on Android where push notifications wouldn't be forwarded after the app was closed.
- Fixes an issue on iOS preventing in-app message subscription events from being sent if `subscribeToInAppMessage` is called prior to any `Braze.addListener` calls.
- Changed the Java compatibility version for the Android plugin to Java 11.

##### Added
- Updates the native iOS bridge [from Braze Swift SDK 6.2.0 to 6.3.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/6.2.0...6.3.1#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).

## 5.1.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue that occured whenever a custom event is logged with dictionary properties using a key named "type".
- Removes the automatic assignment of [`BrazeDelegate`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/delegate) in the iOS bridge, allowing for custom implementations to be assigned to the `braze` instance.

## 5.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updates the native iOS bridge [from Braze Swift SDK 5.13.0 to 6.2.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/compare/5.13.0...6.2.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4edR1).
- Removes `setSDKFlavor` and `setMetadata`, which were no-ops starting from version `2.0.0`.
  - On iOS, these fields must be set using the `Braze.Configuration` object at SDK initialization.
  - On Android, these fields must be set via the `braze.xml` file.

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue on Android with `getNewsFeedCards()` and `getContentCards()` where promises could be invoked more than once.

##### Added
- Updates the native Android bridge [from Braze Android SDK 24.3.0 to 25.0.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/compare/v24.3.0...v25.0.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).

## 4.1.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the `PushNotificationEvent` object introduced in `2.0.1` where a field was named `context_text` instead of the correct value of `content_text`.

##### Added
- Adds support for the upcoming Braze Feature Flags product with the following methods:
  - `getFeatureFlag(id)`
  - `getAllFeatureFlags()`
  - `refreshFeatureFlags()`
  - `getFeatureFlagBooleanProperty(id, key)`
  - `getFeatureFlagStringProperty(id, key)`
  - `getFeatureFlagNumberProperty(id, key)`
- Adds the Braze Event key `Braze.Events.FEATURE_FLAGS_UPDATED` for subscribing to Feature Flags updates.

## 4.0.0

##### Breaking
- The iOS bridge now automatically attaches the default In-App Message UI with the `braze` instance, without needing to call `subscribeToInAppMessage()`. This updates the behavior from `2.0.0` to simplify integration.
  - This change doesn't affect integrations using custom UIs for in-app messages.
- Changes the returned value when subscribing to `Braze.Events.CONTENT_CARDS_UPDATED` to be a `Braze.ContentCardsUpdatedEvent` object instead of a boolean.
  - `Braze.ContentCardsUpdatedEvent` contains a `cards` property which is an array of the Content Cards in the update.
  - Thanks @Minishlink for your contribution!

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the iOS bridge where `getContentCards()` and `getNewsFeedCards()` returned data in a different format than the Android bridge.
- Fixes the behavior when using the recommended iOS integration where the React Bridge delegate had conflicts with other dependencies. The updated sample app code can be found [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/AppDelegate.mm).

##### Added
- Updates the native iOS bridge to [Braze Swift SDK 5.13.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#5130).
- Improves typescript definitions for `addListener` event types.

## 3.0.0

> Starting with this release, this SDK will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

##### ⚠ Breaking
- Fixes the behavior in the iOS bridge introduced in version `2.0.0` when logging clicks for in-app messages, content cards, and news feed cards. Calling `logClick` now only sends a click event for metrics, instead of both sending a click event as well as redirecting to the associated `url` field.
  - For instance, to log a content card click and redirect to a URL, you will need two commands:
  ```
  Braze.logContentCardClicked(contentCard.id);

  // Your own custom implementation
  Linking.openUrl(contentCard.url);
  ```
  - This brings the iOS behavior to match version `1.x` and bring parity with Android's behavior.

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the iOS bridge introduced in `2.0.0` where `getContentCards()` and `getNewsFeedCards()` would return an array of cards with the `url` and `image` fields as `null`.

##### Changed
- Updates the native iOS bridge to [Braze Swift SDK 5.11.2](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#5112).
- Updates the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 24.3.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2430).
- Updates `getContentCards` on the iOS bridge to initiate a refresh before returning the array of Content Cards. This brings parity with the Android bridge behavior.

## 2.1.0

##### Added
- Added `'DEFINES_MODULE' => 'YES'` to the Cocoapod's xcconfig to remove the need for static framework linkage on iOS when using the Braze Expo plugin.

## 2.0.2

##### Fixed
- Removes the usage of Objective-C modules when importing the Braze Swift SDK for improved compatibility with Objective-C++.
  - When importing `BrazeKit` or `BrazeLocation`, you must use the `#import <Module/Module-Swift.h>` syntax:
    - `@import BrazeKit;` → `#import <BrazeKit/BrazeKit-Swift.h>`
    - `@import BrazeLocation;` → `#import <BrazeLocation/BrazeLocation-Swift.h>`

## 2.0.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes compatibility issues with newer versions of React Native introduced in 2.0.0.
- Fixes an issue where callbacks were not being executed for some user attribute methods.

## 2.0.0

##### ⚠ Breaking
- The Braze React Native SDK npm package has moved from `react-native-appboy-sdk` to `@braze/react-native-sdk`.
- Renames `AppboyReactBridge` and `AppboyReactUtils` to `BrazeReactBridge` and `BrazeReactUtils`, respectively.
- This version requires React Native `0.68` or higher.
- Updates the native iOS bridge to use the new Swift SDK [version 5.9.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#591).
- During migration, update your project with the following changes in your iOS integration:
  - To initialize Braze, [follow these integration steps](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/a2-configure-braze) to create a `configuration` object. Then, add this code to complete the setup:
    ```
    let braze = BrazePlugin.initBraze(configuration)
    ```
  - This migration requires re-identifying users. To do so, you must call the `changeUser` method on the Braze instance for non-anonymous users. You can read more about it [here](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/appboy-migration-guide/#Re-identify-users).
  - To continue using `SDWebImage` as a dependency, add this line to your project's `/ios/Podfile`:
    ```
    pod 'SDWebImage', :modular_headers => true
    ```
      - Then, follow [these setup instructions](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/c3-gif-support).
  - To use the default In-App Message UI, make sure to call `subscribeToInAppMessage()` or else follow [these instructions](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/c1-inappmessageui) to add it to your app.
  - For sample code to help with the migration, reference our sample app and [`AppDelegate.mm`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/AppDelegate.mm) file.
  - If you are integrating this SDK with an application that uses only Objective-C, create an empty Swift file to ensure that all the relevant Swift runtime libraries are linked. Reference [this file](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/empty-file.swift) from our sample app.
- The following methods for News Feed are now no-ops on iOS:
  - `Braze.launchNewsFeed()`
  - `Braze.getCardCountForCategories()`
  - `Braze.getUnreadCardCountForCategories()`
- Updates the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 24.2.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2420).

##### Added
- Adds the following APIs to more easily interface with the News Feed product. Thanks @swissmanu for your contribution!
  - `Braze.getNewsFeedCards()`
  - `Braze.logNewsFeedCardClicked()`
  - `Braze.logNewsFeedCardImpression()`

- Updated the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 3.2.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#320).
  - Added `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to directly use the Firebase messaging event `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT`. This is now the recommended way to integrate Firebase push with Braze. The `AppboyFcmReceiver` should be removed from your `AndroidManifest` and replaced with the following:
    ```
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```

##### Added
- Added `setUserAttributionData()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow setting the attribution data for the current user.
- Added `getInstallTrackingId()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow getting the install tracking id. This method is equivalent to calling `Appboy.getInstallTrackingId()` on Android and returns the IDFV on iOS.

  - See https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/pull/12. Thanks @stief510!
- Added the ability to pass an optional dictionary of News Feed launch options to `launchNewsFeed()`. See `NewsFeedLaunchOptions` for supported keys.
  - For more information on currently supported `NewsFeedLaunchOptions` keys, see the card width and card margin properties on [ABKFeedViewController](http://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_a_b_k_feed_view_controller.html).

## 1.2.0

##### Breaking
- Updates the native iOS bridge to be compatible with React Native [v0.40.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.40.0).

##### Changed
- Updates the AppboyProject sample project to React Native v0.41.1.

## 1.1.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Fixes a bug in the [iOS bridge](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/iOS/BrazeReactBridge/BrazeReactBridge/BrazeReactBridge.mm) where custom attribute dates were converted incorrectly, causing incorrect date data to be sent to Braze. As a result of the fix, `setDateCustomUserAttribute()` in the iOS React bridge may now only be called with a double.
  - Note: The default Javascript Braze interface has not changed, so for most integrations this just requires updating the SDK, unless you were manually calling our iOS bridge outside of our recommended integration.
  - See https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/issues/7

## 1.0.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Updates iOS push handling in the AppboyProject sample project to be compatible with iOS 10. For more information, refer to the CHANGELOG for [Braze iOS SDK v2.24.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2240).

##### Added
- Adds callbacks to the native bindings to provide function call results to React Native.
- Exposes `ReactAppboy.getCardCountForCategories()` and `ReactAppboy.getUnreadCardCountForCategories()` for retrieving News Feed card counts.
  - See https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/issues/1
- Adds `ReactAppboy.getInitialURL()` for handling deep links when an iOS application is launched from the suspended state by clicking on a push notification with a deep link. See `componentDidMount()` in `AppboyProject.js` for a sample implementation.
- Exposes `ReactAppboy.setTwitterData()` and `ReactAppboy.setFacebookData()` for Twitter and Facebook integration.
  - See https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/issues/4

##### Changed
- Targets [Braze Android SDK version 1.15.3](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1153) and [Braze iOS SDK version 2.24.2](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2242).
- Updates the AppboyProject sample application to React Native v0.33.0.
- Updates the AppboyProject sample project to integrate session handling and in-app message manager registration using an [AppboyLifecycleCallbackListener](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-android-sdk/blob/master/android-sdk-ui/src/main/java/com/braze/BrazeActivityLifecycleCallbackListener.kt), as introduced in Braze Android SDK v1.15.0.

##### Removed
- Removes `AppboyBroadcastReceiver.java` from the AppboyProject sample project, as Braze Android SDK v1.15.0 removes the need for a custom `AppboyBroadcastReceiver` for Braze push notifications.
