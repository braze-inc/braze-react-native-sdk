# Unreleased

- Removed `setSDKFlavor` and `setMetadata` which did nothing on all platforms. Removes annoying logging on iOS.

# 4.1.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the `PushNotificationEvent` object introduced in `2.0.1` where a field was named `context_text` instead of the correct value of `content_text`.

##### Added
- Adds support for the upcoming Braze Feature Flags product with the following methods:
  - `getFeatureFlag(id)`
  - `getAllFeatureFlags()`
  - `refreshFeatureFlags()`
  - `getFeatureFlagBooleanProperty(id, key)`
  - `getFeatureFlagStringProperty(id, key)`
  - `getFeatureFlagNumberProperty(id, key)`
- Adds the Braze Event key `Braze.Events.FEATURE_FLAGS_UPDATED` for subscribing to Feature Flags updates.

# 4.0.0

##### Breaking
- The iOS bridge now automatically attaches the default In-App Message UI with the `braze` instance, without needing to call `subscribeToInAppMessage()`. This updates the behavior from `2.0.0` to simplify integration.
  - This change doesn't affect integrations using custom UIs for in-app messages.
- Changes the returned value when subscribing to `Braze.Events.CONTENT_CARDS_UPDATED` to be a `Braze.ContentCardsUpdatedEvent` object instead of a boolean.
  - `Braze.ContentCardsUpdatedEvent` contains a `cards` property which is an array of the Content Cards in the update.
  - Thanks @Minishlink for your contribution!

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the iOS bridge where `getContentCards()` and `getNewsFeedCards()` returned data in a different format than the Android bridge.
- Fixes the behavior when using the recommended iOS integration where the React Bridge delegate had conflicts with other dependencies. The updated sample app code can be found [here](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/AppDelegate.mm).

##### Added
- Updates the native iOS bridge to [Braze Swift SDK 5.13.0](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#5130).
- Improves typescript definitions for `addListener` event types.

# 3.0.0

> Starting with this release, this SDK will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

##### ⚠ Breaking
- Fixes the behavior in the iOS bridge introduced in version `2.0.0` when logging clicks for in-app messages, content cards, and news feed cards. Calling `logClick` now only sends a click event for metrics, instead of both sending a click event as well as redirecting to the associated `url` field.
  - For instance, to log a content card click and redirect to a URL, you will need two commands:
  ```
  Braze.logContentCardClicked(contentCard.id);

  // Your own custom implementation
  Linking.openUrl(contentCard.url);
  ```
  - This brings the iOS behavior to match version `1.x` and bring parity with Android's behavior.

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue in the iOS bridge introduced in `2.0.0` where `getContentCards()` and `getNewsFeedCards()` would return an array of cards with the `url` and `image` fields as `null`.

##### Changed
- Updates the native iOS bridge to [Braze Swift SDK 5.11.2](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#5112).
- Updates the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 24.3.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2430).
- Updates `getContentCards` on the iOS bridge to initiate a refresh before returning the array of Content Cards. This brings parity with the Android bridge behavior.

# 2.1.0

##### Added
- Added `'DEFINES_MODULE' => 'YES'` to the Cocoapod's xcconfig to remove the need for static framework linkage on iOS when using the Braze Expo plugin.

# 2.0.2

##### Fixed
- Removes the usage of Objective-C modules when importing the Braze Swift SDK for improved compatibility with Objective-C++.
  - When importing `BrazeKit` or `BrazeLocation`, you must use the `#import <Module/Module-Swift.h>` syntax:
    - `@import BrazeKit;` → `#import <BrazeKit/BrazeKit-Swift.h>`
    - `@import BrazeLocation;` → `#import <BrazeLocation/BrazeLocation-Swift.h>`

# 2.0.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes compatibility issues with newer versions of React Native introduced in 2.0.0.
- Fixes an issue where callbacks were not being executed for some user attribute methods.

# 2.0.0

##### ⚠ Breaking
- The Braze React Native SDK npm package has moved from `react-native-appboy-sdk` to `@braze/react-native-sdk`.
- Renames `AppboyReactBridge` and `AppboyReactUtils` to `BrazeReactBridge` and `BrazeReactUtils`, respectively.
- This version requires React Native `0.68` or higher.
- Updates the native iOS bridge to use the new Swift SDK [version 5.9.1](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#591).
- During migration, update your project with the following changes in your iOS integration:
  - To initialize Braze, [follow these integration steps](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/a2-configure-braze) to create a `configuration` object. Then, add this code to complete the setup:
    ```
    let braze = BrazePlugin.initBraze(configuration)
    ```
  - To continue using `SDWebImage` as a dependency, add this line to your project's `/ios/Podfile`:
    ```
    pod 'SDWebImage', :modular_headers => true
    ```
      - Then, follow [these setup instructions](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/c3-gif-support).
  - To use the default In-App Message UI, make sure to call `subscribeToInAppMessage()` or else follow [these instructions](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/c1-inappmessageui) to add it to your app.
  - For sample code to help with the migration, reference our sample app and [`AppDelegate.mm`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/AppDelegate.mm) file.
  - If you are integrating this SDK with an application that uses only Objective-C, create an empty Swift file to ensure that all the relevant Swift runtime libraries are linked. Reference [this file](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-react-native-sdk/blob/master/BrazeProject/ios/BrazeProject/empty-file.swift) from our sample app.
- The following methods for News Feed are now no-ops on iOS:
  - `Braze.launchNewsFeed()`
  - `Braze.getCardCountForCategories()`
  - `Braze.getUnreadCardCountForCategories()`
- Updates the native Android bridge to [Braze Android SDK 24.2.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2420).

##### Added
- Adds the following APIs to more easily interface with the News Feed product. Thanks @swissmanu for your contribution!
  - `Braze.getNewsFeedCards()`
  - `Braze.logNewsFeedCardClicked()`
  - `Braze.logNewsFeedCardImpression()`

            classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        }
    }
  ```

##### Added
- Introduced `Braze.Events.PUSH_NOTIFICATION_EVENT` which can be used to listen for Braze Push Notification events on Android. See example below:
  ```javascript
  Braze.addListener(Braze.Events.PUSH_NOTIFICATION_EVENT, function(data) {
    console.log(`Push Notification event of type ${data.push_event_type} seen.

      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
    - Also note that any `c2dm` related permissions should be removed from your manifest as Braze does not require any extra permissions for `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to work correctly.
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.14.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.14.0).

  - __Important:__ Note that in Braze Android SDK 2.7.0, `AppboyGcmReceiver` was renamed to `AppboyFcmReceiver`. This receiver is intended to be used for Firebase integrations. Please update the `AppboyGcmReceiver` declaration in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to reference `AppboyFcmReceiver` and remove the `com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION` intent filter action.
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.8.3](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.8.3).

##### Added
- Added `setLocationCustomAttribute()` to the `Appboy` interface to allow setting of custom location attributes.

## 1.7.3

##### Added
- Added support for wiping all customer data created by the Braze SDK via `Appboy.wipeData()`.
  - Note that on iOS, `wipeData()` will disable the SDK for the remainder of the app run. For more information, see our iOS SDK's documentation for [`disableSDK`](http://appboy.github.io/appboy-ios-sdk/docs/interface_appboy.html#a8d3b78a98420713d8590ed63c9172733).

## 1.2.0

##### Breaking
- Updates the native iOS bridge to be compatible with React Native [v0.40.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.40.0).

##### Changed
- Updates the AppboyProject sample project to React Native v0.41.1.

## 1.1.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Fixes a bug in the [iOS bridge](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/blob/master/iOS/AppboyReactBridge/AppboyReactBridge/AppboyReactBridge.m) where custom attribute dates were converted incorrectly, causing incorrect date data to be sent to Braze. As a result of the fix, `setDateCustomUserAttribute()` in the iOS React bridge may now only be called with a double.
  - Note: The default Javascript Braze interface has not changed, so for most integrations this just requires updating the SDK, unless you were manually calling our iOS bridge outside of our recommended integration.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/issues/7

## 1.0.0

##### Breaking
- **Update Required** — Updates iOS push handling in the AppboyProject sample project to be compatible with iOS 10. For more information, refer to the CHANGELOG for [Braze iOS SDK v2.24.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2240).

##### Added
- Adds callbacks to the native bindings to provide function call results to React Native.
- Exposes `ReactAppboy.getCardCountForCategories()` and `ReactAppboy.getUnreadCardCountForCategories()` for retrieving News Feed card counts.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/issues/1
- Adds `ReactAppboy.getInitialURL()` for handling deep links when an iOS application is launched from the suspended state by clicking on a push notification with a deep link. See `componentDidMount()` in `AppboyProject.js` for a sample implementation.
- Exposes `ReactAppboy.setTwitterData()` and `ReactAppboy.setFacebookData()` for Twitter and Facebook integration.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-react-sdk/issues/4

##### Changed
- Targets [Braze Android SDK version 1.15.3](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1153) and [Braze iOS SDK version 2.24.2](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2242).
- Updates the AppboyProject sample application to React Native v0.33.0.

##### Removed
- Removes `AppboyBroadcastReceiver.java` from the AppboyProject sample project, as Braze Android SDK v1.15.0 removes the need for a custom `AppboyBroadcastReceiver` for Braze push notifications.
